Display “You will save x %” on the product details page in OXID eShop

This is a plug-and-play working module for displaying the saving in percent if you entered a real price and the recommended retail price (RRP) in your OXID eShop. 
The module was developed on the basis of OXID eShop version 4.7.3 and is an example for how to write modules for OXID eShop version 4.7 and above.
